# Cross-Chain-NFTs

For quite some time I have been in blockchain space and have been following cryptos for quite a long time I love the Ethereum ecosystem a lot (I'm not referring to others as bad), so a few of my friends were working on different chains like Solana and Algorand and they were making cool products out of it, out of curiosity I just requested them to lend me some tokens they do but I have to pay them in their chains native currency which was SOL, I thought of transferring them ETH or fiat but they were not ready to get it, they needed only in SOL so I thought of swapping my ETH to SOL but there were not good DEX, where there for cross-chain swaps but somewhere out there I have been learning about Router and the products they were building, so just scrolling their site found their in-house product Voyager which was helping to solve the issue of Swapping cross-chain which was a saver for me.

You will be like why the hell am I saying you the story about cross-chain swapping the next revolution of Blockchain Technology is going to belong to Cross-chaining or Bridging because Infrastures are being built, Exchanges are also being built, but where is cross-chain bridging which can help us not only transfer our funds directly but also minimize the process.

One such protocol which has been working on Cross-chain bridging is RouterProtocol :)
