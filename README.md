# Cross-Chain-NFTs

For quite sometime I have been in blockchain space and have been following cryptos for quite long time and I love the Ethereum ecosystem alot(I'm not refering others as bad), so few of my friends where working on different chains like Solana and Argorand and they were making cool products out of it, out of curiosity I just requested them to lend me some tokens they do but I have to pay them in there chains native currency which was SOL, I thought of transfering them ETH or fiat but they were not ready to get it, they needed only in SOL so I thought of swapping my ETH to SOL but not good DEX where there for cross-chain swaps but somewhere out there I have been learning about Router and the products they were building , so just scrolling their site found their in-house product Voyager which was helping to solve the issue of Swapping cross-chain which was saver for me.

You will be like why the hell am I saying you the story about cross-chain swapping because the next revolution of Blockchain Technology is going to belong to Cross-chaining or Bridging because Infrastures are being built, Exchanges are also being built, but where is cross-chain bridging which can help us not only transfer our funds directly but also minimize the process.

One such protocol which has been working on Cross-chain bridging is RouterProtocol :)
